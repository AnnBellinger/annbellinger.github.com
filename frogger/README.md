Aspects Implemented Correctly:
1. Game-board layout
2. Loads on load of page
3. Frog moves with key press
4. Basic scoring
5. Animated moving objects
6. Collision detection with water, cars, or lillypads
7. Fly appears at random, if frog eats fly, add 200 points
8. Timer
9. Deadfrog appears when no lives are left
10. Level progression if 5 frogs are jumped home
